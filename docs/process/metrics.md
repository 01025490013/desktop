# GitHub Desktop Metrics

Desktop is a free, open source product that is maintained and worked on by the small, distributed team of @desktop/core, @desktop/comrades, and the general open-source community. As a result, we do not have the resources to do continuous, detailed user studies of GitHub Desktop users and usage. In other words, we love you, we want to build the right features to help you, and yet we don't know enough about you as a whole to make informed prioritization decisions.

We measure certain events in the GitHub Desktop app in order to learn more about how you are using the app. This helps us prioritize features and bugs and understand what things are most important to the largest number of people. Our understanding of these metrics is supplemented by some user research, usability testing, and feedback from the community. This document is intended to provide information about each thing we're measuring and what we're using it for.

You can always see our recently released user-facing features and fixes in the [release notes](https://desktop.github.com/release-notes/) of our marketing page, and example usage data [here](https://desktop.github.com/usage-data/).
